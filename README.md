## Description

Due to covid-19, unorganised workers and poor people have suffered the most. Even though the state and the central governments launched a lot of schemes to aid these people but there are still a substantial number of people who are not  unaware of the support facilities they can avail. Also the complexity of availing these services and not having the knowledge and resources (mobile phones, internet, etc.) to do so could also pose as a hindrance in receiving the benefits. 

A simple solution is to provide a mechanism/platform which connects the aid providers (Gov orgs, NGOs, etc.) with the bypasses who see the person in need and want to help them without requiring much involvement from the needy. The projects aims to create a web app which connects these bypassers with the aid providers by providing the basic details on the platform such as name, age, contact/address, etc. A database is created using Typeform and a trigger is created using automate.io to alert the concerned aid providers that a new person is in queue so that the help could be provided in a seamless and systemic way. This is effective especially in the time of lockdown and natural calamity where the new registration to receive government sponsored benefits could take time. The code is written in HTML using Visual Studio code.
